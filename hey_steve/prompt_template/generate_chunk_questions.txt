You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a single, realistic question-answer pair based on a given document. 
The question should be something a user might naturally ask when seeking information contained in the document.

Given: {chunk}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the key topics, facts, and concepts in the given document, choose one to focus on.
2. Generate ten similar questions that a user might ask to find the information in this document that does NOT contain any item, block, and mob name.
3. Use natural language and occasionally include typos or colloquialisms to mimic real user behavior in the question.
4. Ensure the question is semantically related to the document content WITHOUT directly copying phrases.
5. Make sure that all of the questions are similar to eachother. I.E. All asking about a similar topic/requesting the same information.

Output Format:
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{{
  "question_1": "Generated question text",
  "question_2": "Generated question text",
  ...
}}
```

Be creative, think like a curious user, and generate your 10 similar questions that would naturally lead to the given document in a semantic search. Ensure your response is a valid JSON object containing only the questions.
