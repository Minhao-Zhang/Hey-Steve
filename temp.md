For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see Dungeons:Husk. 

A husk is a variant of zombie that spawns in deserts. They function similarly to zombies, except they do not burn in sunlight, and they inflict Hunger with their unarmed attacks. 

## Spawning

Husks spawn at a light level of 0 in the desert, mostly replacing zombies in these biomes. 

In Java Edition, husks spawn directly under the sky in groups of 4 in place of 80% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes. 

In Bedrock Edition, husks spawn on the surface in groups of 2-4 in place of 70% of all zombies spawned in desert biomes. 

### Trial spawners

Husks have a chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers. 

### Reinforcements

This feature is exclusive to  Java Edition.

On hard difficulty, husks have a 5% chance to spawn as leaders. Leader husks spawn other husks as reinforcements. 

## Variants

### Baby husks and chicken jockeys

Three adult husks and one baby husk. All mobs that can be ridden by baby husks in Bedrock Edition.

In Java Edition, there is a 5% chance for husks to spawn as babies, and baby husks have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey. 

In Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby husks can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem. They can ride: 

  * Adult chickens
  * Untamed ocelots
  * Untamed cats
  * Untamed wolves
  * Adult zombies
  * Adult husks
  * Adult zombified villagers
  * Adult zombified piglins
  * Cows
  * Adult unsaddled pigs
  * Sheep
  * Adult untamed horses
  * Adult untamed donkeys
  * Adult untamed mules
  * Adult skeleton horses
  * Adult zombie horses
  * Mooshrooms
  * Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount
  * Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount
  * Pandas



Husks spawn with random values of knockback resistance between 0% and 5%. 

## Behavior

A husk that drowns converts to a zombie (which can convert to a drowned).

Like zombies, husks are hostile toward the player, iron golems, villagers, baby turtles, and wandering traders. They pursue these mobs on sight from up to 40 blocks away, as opposed to 16 blocks like most other hostile mobs. If any other mob attacks a husk on purpose, all other husks and zombie variants (except zombified piglins) within a 67Ã—67Ã—21 to 111Ã—111Ã—21 area become hostile toward the attacker. They attempt to avoid obstacles, including sheer cliffs, water, and lava, and try to find the shortest path to the player. 

Husks apply Hunger to any player or mob they hit using a melee attack, unless the husk is holding an item in its main hand or the player blocks the attack with a shield. This effect lasts for 7 Ã— floor (regional difficulty) seconds. 

Husks can break down doors on Hard difficulty. 

Husks seek out any nearby turtle eggs and trample them. 

Husks can pick up items if the game rule `mobGriefing` is set to true, which prevents them from despawning. 

A husk that is submerged in water for 30 seconds begins converting to a normal zombie, which takes an additional 15 seconds and cannot be stopped even if the husk leaves water. Once this process finishes, the zombie that it becomes has full health even if the husk has been damaged, and may further convert into a drowned if it remains submerged. 

Being an undead mob, they are: 

  * damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage.
  * unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.
  * ignored by the wither.
  * affected by the Smite enchantment.
  * unable to swim in water, but do not drown.
  * a threat to armadillos, causing them to hide in their shell.

| Rotten Flesh| 100%| 0â€“2| 0â€“3| 0â€“4| 0â€“5  
  
### Rare drops

Husks may also drop one of the following when killed by a player or tamed wolf: 

Item | Roll Chance | Quantity (Roll Chance)  
---|---|---  
Default | Looting I | Looting II | Looting III  
| Iron Ingot| 0.83%â€“1.82%[d 1]| 1 (0.83%)| 1 (1.16%)| 1 (1.49%)| 1 (1.82%)

| Potato[d 2]| 0.83%â€“1.82%[d 1]| 1 (0.83%)| 1 (1.16%)| 1 (1.49%)| 1 (1.82%)  
  
  1. â†‘ a b c Dropped only when kill credit is given to the player
  2. â†‘ Dropped as baked potato if on fire when killed.



### Taken equipment

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up. 

### Naturally-spawned equipment

Husk have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), with random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include: 

  * Iron Shovel
  * Iron Sword
  * Random Armor (sometimes enchanted, made from leather, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)



### Experience

Adult husks drop 5 and an additional 1â€“3 per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby husks drop 12\.
